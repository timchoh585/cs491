      <h3>My thoughts on AR/VR</h3>
      <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
        My initial thoughts on the demos was something like, "gee wiz, this class is awesome!"
        The first thing I went to was the HTC Vive.  The Vive is really cool because it tracks
        all of your movement based on two hands and a headset.  And then all the extrapolated 
        data that comes with it: wingspan, height, shoulder distance, and other areas of 
        measurement.  It was a fun experience and I understand why people would fall down while 
        trying to navigate through Google Earth.  It feels like you are in a different space
        and that the you have a lot of control of what your seeing through the Vive.  There is 
        not that much that is holding you back from flying around the world; it all comes down 
        to imagination and how you use it to navigate through a virtual world.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;" >
        To Compare the Google Earth VR and the Circus Games VR, they both use the controls 
        in different ways.  The Google Earth VR uses the hand controls to navigate around 
        the map, whereas the Circus Games uses it to actually be your hands in virtual 
        space.  It is some weird emulation that is being occured to allow someone to think 
        that their physics hands are actually being used in virtual space like that.  It 
        kind of gives a sense of a false reality.  Some negative to come from that would 
        be that the user would actually choose to stay in virtual space rather than in 
        reality.  There are a lot of movies that have the idea of being "plugged in", and 
        I think that that is becoming more and more prominent in the reality that we live 
        in right now with all the new technologies that allow people to feel like that.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;" >
        But moving from VR, I want to talk about the AR.  The HoloLens is really bringing 
        reality in virtual world.  The game that we played, some space alien shooter game, 
        was a cool way to integrate the real world with a virtual world.  I am not sure why 
        but it felt like it was the norm of how people should live.  Having something 
        be augmented over the real world, visually, can become very handy in more than one 
        case.  For construction workers to be able to see what they are working with or 
        if they need to take things apart, they can see that in augmented reality before 
        acually doing something.  Something like this would be good in the medical field 
        to show a body while in surgery to make better educated decisions on where to 
        have the surgery.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;" >
        Moving on from AR and VR, I played with the SAGE2 Wall and the Cave 2.  Both of 
        them are very unique in their own way and they provide ways of visualizing things 
        that were previously very difficult to view.  In the Cave, we were shown a demo 
        about the the inside of the brain with the connections.  We were able to move 
        in close and view the different directions of connections that were in the brain.
          That is very useful in the medical field.  They can teach classes in different 
        ways.  Before, students would have to imagine what the demos would look like, but 
        being inside of an environment where the users can see, in real time, the brain 
        and see what they are learning.  I was also shown that a team from NASA was in 
        the Cave and they were testing out a robot probe that would send signals out and 
        map the bottom of the ocean.  That is a very unique thing to be able to visualize 
        in a space that is all around you rather than just in a small rectangle that is 
        infront of your face.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;" >
        To talk more about the SAGE wall, in a classroom, that is phenominal.  It really 
        helps students be able to see what a professor is talking about and be able to 
        see up close what is happening.  Having such a big screen to display a lot of 
        information to the students all at once gives a student time to digest the information 
        and be able to know what they are learning at a faster rate.  For me personally, 
        if I can see a big set of information and be able to work through it whilst the 
        professor is talking about it, it gives me a chance to test myself as well as 
        learn from the professor if I do not understand.  Its different than having to 
        go from one slide to another because I don't see the whole picture.  If I can see 
        more of what I am learning at once, then I can understand why I am learning 
        something and how it applies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5em;" >
        All in all, the demos really showed me some cool things about what modern technology 
        can do and what it can improve on.  I like the fact that a user can visually 
        be somewhere else while their body is here.  Its a unique experience to be able to 
        emulate and visually show.
